0.4     2004-08-28
	* FLAC transcoding support.
	* MP4 transcoding support added via libfaad.
	* Crossfader added.
	* Tested with LAME 3.96.1
0.3     2003-07-13
	* Updated to libshout2, which brings icecast2 compatibility.
	* ices will now attempt to trim junk and short frames from MP3 files,
	  which should help if you've been hearing chirps between songs.
	* Reencoding is much more reliable - VBR, sampling rate changes, and
	  a wide variety of bitrates have been tested.
	* Stability stability stability.
	* Ogg reencoding works on bigendian (eg PowerPC) systems now.
	* Mono reencoding bug fixed.
	* ID3v2 tag support.
	* A blank line in a playlist will terminate ices.
	* -i (icy_compat) has been removed in favor of -t 'protocol'
0.2.3	2002-05-01
	As always, the longer the time between releases, the less changed:
	* ices no longer uses threads, making it much leaner and more portable.
	* bundled with libshout 1.0.9, which makes it much less likely to
	  segfault on normal MP3 files.
	* Will now attempt to reload playlist modules when sighup'd. Make your
	  scripting changes without interrupting your stream.
	* Still includes a number of bugs (see BUGS)
0.2.2	2001-08-01
	* You can now specify the host and port for each mount point
	  separately. In fact, you have to.
	* MP3 encoding output buffer size increased, seems to handle VBRs
	  better, don't know why this is necessary at the moment.
	* Thread stack size increased again.
	* Write to stdout directly for usage/-V info, so it doesn't get
	  swallowed if ices is configured to run in the background.
	* Include system configuration info in ices -V output.
	* Use setsid() to detach from tty, not setpgid().
	* Load perl module as a proper module. This means you'd better return
	  1 at the end of your module.
	* Set PYTHONPATH reliably (not using an automatic variable), and
	  removed the arbitrary length limit.
	* Log file no longer appends PID. In general I think this is a silly
	  practice. I would have removed it from the cue file too, but a)
	  I don't use the cue file, and b) it at least cleans up after itself
	  on exit.
	* Build dependency bugs fixed.
0.2.1	2001-07-12
	* Thread stack size increased, to prevent segfaults during metadata
	  updates on Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and probably anything that
	  isn't Linux.
	* Sleep code fixed to work better on other platforms. Solaris users
	  should be happy.
	* All playlist functions but ices_get_next made optional.
	* Compatibility code uses old ices_(perl|python)_... function names
	  if new, documented (man 1 ices) functions aren't found.
0.2	2001-06-29
	* This is a development release. It is not guaranteed to be as stable
	  as 0.1.
	* Multiple streams are supported. Add multiple stream sections to
	  ices.conf or use multiple -m options on the command line. See the
	  man page for details.
	* Oh yeah, there's a man page.
	* ices can decode ogg vorbis files and reencode them as MP3
	* New ices_get_metadata function added for playlist scripts.
	* Better recovery from transient network problems.
	* SIGUSR1 causes ices to jump to the next track
0.1.0	2001-06-15
	* Reencoder updated to new LAME API of 3.88.
	* new option --with-xmlconfig when building to locate xml libraries
	* configure looks for python 2
	* new commandline option -V for version/feature info
	* cue file song length field now correct
	* BaseDirectory configuration option works
	* support for using an installed libshout
	* fixes to metadata update (first song metadata now set)
0.0.1b5	2000-08-29
	* Perl module now supports dynamic loading of modules (e.g "use Socket")
	* Ices now exits after 10 consecutive filename or other errors. (Removes spamming problems)
0.0.1b4	2000-08-24
	* New options to change sample rate and number of channels
	  when reencoding.
0.0.1b3	2000-08-08
	* Reencoding fixes, commented config file and README.playlist
	* Changed perl module to use user specified module
	* ices.py and ices.pm now commented
	* Configure.in now checks for gmake, and tells user to use this
	  if found.
	* ices.pm,ices.py and README.playlist included in dist.
	* Moved README to README.old and lynx -dump -nolist on
	  doc/icesmanual.html to the new README. (I don't want to
	  maintain two sets of documentation)
	* Started to work on the FAQ
0.0.1b2	2000-08-02
	* Code cleanup, lots of code comments added
0.0.1b1	2000-07-19
	* first release
